                                    self-report and neurophysiological data in a new measurement system. Multi-sensor
                                    and multimodal methods were used through longitudinal follow-up at one-week
                                    intervals across three sessions. We tracked individuals' scores to analyze their
                                    evolution over time and establish meaningful correlations within each participant.
                                    Psychometric tests such as Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and
                                    State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S) were used to correlate self-report measures
                                    of anxiety and depression with neurophysiological measures. Control psychometric
                                    measures such as 10-Item Big Five Inventory (BFI-10), STAI-T, and Fear Questionnaire
                                    (FQ) were also included. We collected a significant quantity of raw data from
                                    eye-tracking and heart rate variability (HRV) sensors from (n=4) resulting in a
                                    comprehensive dataset used for data analysis. Preliminary results showed that on
                                    average for each participant HRV, fixation, and saccade rate were higher during
                                    psychometric testing compared to the baseline measurement. With high-quality sensors
                                    that provide accurate physiological data we can create more personalized predictive
                                    models for anxiety and depression with machine learning (ML), potentially enabling
                                    their use in psychological assessments in the coming years.</p>

                                    the integration of information from different sensory modalities (e.g., visual and
                                    tactile) and spatial frames (first person perspective (1PP) and third-person

                                    Bathing Ritual" to alter attentional biases towards body parts related to weight. We
                                    enlisted forty healthy adults and assessed their user experience via the GAMEX and
                                    SUS scales. A randomized controlled trial, aimed at contrasting gamified with
                                    non-gamified approaches, was developed for this purpose. No significant differences
                                    in usability were found between the groups (SUS, p = 0.38), but the gamified group
                                    showed high satisfaction (GAMEX mean = 76.45) with notable enjoyment (mean = 19) and
                                    absorption (mean = 22.75). These findings suggest that gamification enhances
                                    specific user experiences like enjoyment and immersion, though overall usability was
                                    similar across both groups.</p>

                                    performing prediction model was found to be random forest, which achieved a
                                    prediction accuracy of 90.2%, precision of 90.3%, recall of 90.3%, and F1-score of

                                    predicting dropout at TUMO were found to be the pedagogic engagement factors, as the
                                    top ten predictors were all part of this category. To a lesser extent,
                                    sociodemographic factors influence dropout and reported pathologies were found to
                                    not be significant predictors of dropout by themselves but more so when a student is

                                    with the more significant effect on dropout behavior was learning disorders.</p>

                                    Language Model (LLM) to analyze verbal speech patterns to assess attachment styles
                                    and tendencies toward anxiety and depression. A diverse sample of 50 adults
                                    participated in the study. Participants were presented with images based on the
                                    Adult Attachment Projective Picture System (AAP) and asked to describe the scenes,
                                    with their responses transcribed and analyzed by the LLM. The LLM's identification
                                    of attachment styles showed a 58% true positive rate compared to the Relationship
                                    Questionnaire (RQ). The LLM overestimated anxiety and underestimated depression
                                    compared to the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). These findings suggest
                                    that while LLMs show promise in attachment assessment, further refinement in context
                                    and prompt engineering is needed to improve accuracy, particularly concerning
                                    anxiety and depression evaluations. The study underscores the potential for
                                    automated tools in psychological assessment, paving the way for future research in

                                    publications on 3MDR in Dutch and British veterans, our study was unique in being
                                    the first to address military personnel with both PTSD and TBI, the first to include
                                    significant numbers of women (50%), and in demonstrating that the eye movement
                                    element of 3MDR added significant benefit, by randomizing participants to either

                                    (VR) and the Metaverse to address the psychological impacts of the Ukrainian
                                    conflict on military personnel and civilians. Leveraging these technologies, the
                                    project has four primary initiatives: (1) Adapting the BRAVEMIND VR Exposure Therapy
                                    (VRET) system for PTSD treatment to reflect the Ukrainian conflict, creating
                                    relevant virtual environments for therapeutic exposure. (2) Employing a digital
                                    version of Sandtray therapy for Ukrainian children affected by Adverse Childhood
                                    Experiences, allowing for narrative play and emotional expression. (3) Developing a
                                    metaverse-enabled social support application, facilitating clinician-driven and
                                    peer-supported group processes for displaced individuals, offering a platform for
                                    emotional support and shared experiences. (4) Integrating "The Sanctuary," a VR
                                    application for mindfulness, meditation and relaxation activities, serving as a
                                    supplementary tool for stress and trauma management. Highlighting VR's potential for
                                    immersive therapy, the project aims to provide a comprehensive set of VR tools for
                                    mental health care in conflict zones, demonstrating VR's innovative, accessible, and

                                    life. This study aims to evaluate a newly developed virtual environment for exposure
                                    therapy of aviophobia using a comparison of subjective anxiety ratings between an

                                    neuropsychological assessment has been observed: from a localizationist perspective
                                    to one focused on predicting everyday function. In numerous clinical disorders,
                                    cognitive deficits lead to compromises in functional abilities. However, current
                                    assessment instruments fail to be representative of real-world abilities, not
                                    allowing the prediction of the ability to perform activities of daily living.
                                    Technological solutions, such as virtual reality(VR) and wearable technologies, seem
                                    to be promising approaches in neuropsychological assessment, allowing the simulation

                                    with a research governance group comprising individuals with ID. Preliminary
                                    test-retest reliability was examined along with a comparison between the VR-based
                                    task and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), an established cognitive measure.
                                    Eight participants with ID completed the VR task across varying difficulty levels
                                    for between 2 and 4 sessions, with their performance assessed for reliability and
                                    correlation with MoCA scores. Results indicate poor test-retest reliability for the

                                    processes such as decision-making, problem-solving, and social behavior through
                                    behavioral studies. They also serve as standardized testing platforms for assessing
                                    cognitive functions like memory, attention, and language processing. Moreover, VH
                                    can simulate human behavior and emotions, enabling investigations into social
                                    cognition and how individuals perceive and respond to emotions and social cues in
                                    virtual interactions. Throughout the talk, I will provide examples of VH

                                <p class="content-item-abstract">Over recent years, the popularity of virtual reality
                                    (VR) has surged, driven by advancements aimed at enhancing usability and optimizing
                                    human-computer interaction. This paper presents an experiment designed to assess the
                                    effectiveness and efficiency of 2D versus 3D icons as menus in VR environments.
                                    Usability was evaluated using the System Usability Scale (SUS), while user
                                    satisfaction was gauged through the After-Scenario Questionnaire (ASQ).
                                    Additionally, metrics such as task completion time (in seconds) and the frequency of
                                    unnecessary steps (errors) were recorded. 15 participants in this pilot study
                                    consistently rated the 3D menu higher in usability (M = 85 vs. M = 70 for 2D) and
                                    expressed greater satisfaction with task completion and overall system performance.
                                    Performance analysis revealed that the 3D menu facilitated faster task completion
                                    times, fewer non-required steps, and lower error rates compared to the 2D menu.
                                    These findings underscore the benefits of employing 3D menus to enhance both user
                                    experience and operational efficiency within VR applications.</p>

                                     dependence is a behavioral procedure consisting of repeated exposure to
                                    triggers related to the use of addictive substances without inducing the experience
                                    of reward. The goal is the gradual extinction of conditioned reactions to the
                                    relevant stimulus. Risk Environment Simulator (RES©) is a serious game from a
                                    first-person perspective to imitate an ordinary Czech pub with different types of
                                    real-world inspired cues. The idea behind RES development was to mediate a
                                    potentially risky experience based on cue exposure to persons, who are treated in a
                                    safe environment of hospitalization. According to our previous experience, there is
                                    a tendency to overestimate individual resilience to different “risky” cues during
                                    hospitalization in the population of AUD patients. RES could be a tool bringing a
                                    serious game with different types of “unsafe” cues to the “safe” environment of
                                    hospitalization. The scenario of this game is based on a meeting with a friend in a
                                    pub. The person who enters the virtual world has no choice, the meeting must take
                                    place in a pub, which in principle represents a risky environment for people with a
                                    diagnosis of AUD. There are different types of cues in RES, such as proximal cues
                                    (grasping a glass of drink, simulation of drinking an alcoholic drink), contextual
                                    cues (pub equipment, pub noise, people consuming alcohol) and social cues (meeting
                                    with a persuasive, rationalizing or manipulative avatar).</p>

                                <p class="content-item-abstract">In the past decade, the use of virtual reality (VR) in
                                    healthcare has expanded significantly, primarily in professional training and
                                    patient treatment. VR is used to simulate realistic scenarios, essential for
                                    training medical professionals and creating therapeutic environments for patients.
                                    However, creating realistic scenes, especially those involving dynamic human
                                    movement, poses technical challenges due to the high costs and complexity associated
                                    with motion capture technology. Given the budget constraints typical of research
                                    projects, alternative solutions for animating movements, gestures, and facial
                                    expressions are necessary.Our VR application focused on healthcare education
                                    involves training medical students in orthopedics by simulating rare or unavailable
                                    clinical conditions. Unlike expensive simulators, VR allows multiple students to
                                    simultaneously practice and review their actions. Another application focuses on
                                    engaging seniors with interactive cognitive exercises that stimulate decision-making
                                    through virtual environments. Furthermore, VR exposure therapy for treating phobias
                                    in urban settings provides patients with immersive experiences that replicate
                                    real-life situations, enhancing therapeutic outcomes. These applications illustrate
                                    the potential of VR to offer versatile, cost-effective solutions in medical training
                                    and treatment.</p>

                                    signals, such as speech, gestures, and gaze direction. We therefore designed an
                                    experiment focused on these three modalities within virtual reality, which serves as
                                    an effective replica of the complex real world. The design of the experiment was set
                                    in the iGibson simulation environment, where participants were tasked with teaching
                                    the robot to recognize concepts, colors, and more using pointing gestures and
                                    speech, ultimately enabling it to prepare a salad. The experiment was recorded in
                                    VR. Our goal was to determine the relationship between gestures and speech, the time
                                    interval between them, and then create a multimodal fusion that would allow us to
                                    integrate these insights into a real robot.</p>

                                    immersive virtual reality (VR) cognitive intervention for individuals experiencing
                                    post-COVID-19 condition (PCC). Neuropsychological symptoms commonly observed in PCC,
                                    including attention deficits were targeted. Seventeen adults participated in the
                                    study, undergoing baseline neuropsychological assessments, a VR intervention, and
                                    post-intervention evaluations. Results revealed significant improvements in
                                    attention, perceived cognitive status and mood following the intervention.
                                    Participants reported low levels of cybersickness and high levels of engagement and
                                    perceived usefulness of the VR program. While limitations in sample size exist,
                                    findings suggest promising avenues for VR-based interventions in managing cognitive

                                    substantial interest in psychology, particularly in its application to enhance
                                    neuropsychological cognitive assessments. By offering tailored environments and
                                    integrating realistic measurements, VR presents a promising avenue for advancing
                                    clinical procedures. With a global rise in the elderly population, the pursuit of
                                    healthy aging has become paramount, emphasizing the preservation of cognitive
                                    abilities crucial for maintaining quality of life and autonomy. Spatial memory
                                    decline, an early indicator of cognitive decline in aging, underscores the
                                    importance of accurate assessment methodologies. The Corsi-Block Tapping Task, a
                                    conventional method for evaluating spatial memory, has been augmented by VR
                                    technology, providing a dynamic platform to assess cognitive function. However,
                                    concerns persist regarding older individuals' familiarity and attitudes towards VR
                                    technology, potentially influencing performance outcomes. To address this gap, we
                                    aim to investigate the attitudes and experiences of elderly participants (aged 65
                                    and older) towards VR-based cognitive assessments. Utilizing the VR Corsi Task,
                                    participants will undergo cognitive testing alongside traditional Corsi-Block
                                    Tapping Task assessments. Additionally, participants will complete self-reported
                                    questionnaires assessing technology familiarity, user experience, and emotional
                                    states. We anticipate that participants with prior VR experience and positive
                                    attitudes towards technology will exhibit enhanced performance in the VR Corsi Task.
                                    This study contributes to understanding the feasibility and validity of VR
                                    technology in assessing cognitive function among older adults, shedding light on the
