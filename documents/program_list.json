Multi-sensor and multimodal methods were used through longitudinal follow-up at one-week intervals across three sessions. We tracked individuals' scores to analyze their evolution over time and establish meaningful correlations within each participant. Psychometric tests such as Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S) were used to correlate self-report measures of anxiety and depression with neurophysiological measures. Control psychometric measures such as 10-Item Big Five Inventory (BFI-10), STAI-T, and Fear Questionnaire (FQ) were also included. We collected a significant quantity of raw data from eye-tracking and heart rate variability (HRV) sensors from (n=4) resulting in a comprehensive dataset used for data analysis.  Preliminary results showed that on average for each participant HRV, fixation, and saccade rate were higher during psychometric testing compared to the baseline measurement. With high-quality sensors that provide accurate physiological data we can create more personalized predictive models for anxiety and depression with machine learning (ML), potentially enabling their use in psychological assessments in the coming years."

A randomized controlled trial, aimed at contrasting gamified with non-gamified approaches, was developed for this purpose. No significant differences in usability were found between the groups (SUS, p = 0.38), but the gamified group showed high satisfaction (GAMEX mean = 76.45) with notable enjoyment (mean = 19) and absorption (mean = 22.75). These findings suggest that gamification enhances specific user experiences like enjoyment and immersion, though overall usability was similar across both groups."

The most significant factors used in predicting dropout at TUMO were found to be the pedagogic engagement factors, as the top ten predictors were all part of this category. To a lesser extent, sociodemographic factors influence dropout and reported pathologies were found to not be significant predictors of dropout by themselves but more so when a student is affected by more than one physical or mental health issue. The pathology category with the more significant effect on dropout behavior was learning disorders."

A diverse sample of 50 adults participated in the study. Participants were presented with images based on the Adult Attachment Projective Picture System (AAP) and asked to describe the scenes, with their responses transcribed and analyzed by the LLM. The LLM's identification of attachment styles showed a 58% true positive rate compared to the Relationship Questionnaire (RQ). The LLM overestimated anxiety and underestimated depression compared to the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). These findings suggest that while LLMs show promise in attachment assessment, further refinement in context and prompt engineering is needed to improve accuracy, particularly concerning anxiety and depression evaluations. The study underscores the potential for automated tools in psychological assessment, paving the way for future research in this domain."

                        "abstract": "This study explores the application of the Contrast Avoidance Model (CAM) within virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) for treating generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Recognizing GAD's pervasive impact and the limitations of traditional cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), this research aims to design, implement, and evaluate CAM-based intervention that addresses negative contrast sensitivity in GAD patients. We hypothesize that exposure to controlled, discomfort-evoking VR scenarios, coupled with relaxation, can enhance patients' coping mechanisms and reduce anxiety symptoms (Newman et al., 2011). This study zeroes in on evaluating VR scenarios to confirm they trigger negative emotions in GAD patients, crucial for their use in the proposed treatment."

The study will be conducted using VR United, a virtual reality application that enables multiple users to interact together in virtual reality within the same environment, each one with an avatar that looks like themselves. We will compare three experimental conditions: Video call, Virtual Reality call, and Passthrough Virtual Reality call. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, we assess the sense of co-presence, emotional closeness, and engagement of the conversations through self-report questionnaires, interviews, and behavioral observations in these 3 experimental conditions. We will analyze the qualitative findings using sentiment analysis. Findings will provide insights into how Virtual Reality might support long-distance familial or friendship relationships."

Sixty participants will be randomly assigned to either a harassment condition, where they embody a female avatar experiencing sexual harassment, or a control condition, with no harassment. Pre- and post-exposure measures will assess changes in attitudes, while a VR scene will evaluate the potential for encouraging bystander intervention. Results will contribute to understanding VR's effectiveness in preventing harassment in the metaverse by changing perspective through embodiment."

However, we know very little about how aesthetic experiences during art appreciation unfold across time in the human brain. This work aims to investigate the temporal neural correlates of aesthetic experiences with different types of artworks. Participants will view a wide range of visual artworks while we record EEG data. The resulting EEG response patterns will be analyzed in a multivariate representational similarity analysis (RSA) framework, which will allow us to link participants’ explicit ratings of visual aesthetic appeal to their emerging temporal brain dynamics. Our study will clarify how rapidly the brain encodes the aesthetic appeal of visual art, and which features of the artworks enable the emergence of such beauty-related signals."

Remote/virtual users will participate, and self-report questionnaires will be administered for pre-post testing, which will be analyzed alongside the multimodal data."
